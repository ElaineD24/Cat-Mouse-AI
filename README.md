# Cat-Mouse-AI

Background:

This is a game of Cat and Mouse. The mouse will greedily move toward the closest cheese according to its location on the map. The cat will find a way to catch the mouse along its path before the mouse has eaten all the cheeses, with different search algorithms. All cat, mouse, and cheeses positions are randomly generated. The mouse moves like a King in the game of Chess, which is only able to move one step in any direction, while the cat moves like a Knight in the game of Chess.

Search algorithm used:

Breadth-First Search
Depth-First Search
A* Search with two different heuristic functions
